  <span class="access-text">access</span><span class="ceramics-text">Ceramics</span> is a growing collection of images of contemporary ceramics by recognized artists. It is designed for use by artists, arts educators, scholars and the general public, and is intended to fill a void in contemporary ceramics digital image collections on the web. The images are stored within the Flickr photo sharings system, and are accessible through this website as well as the Flickr interface. Submissions are juried by a curatorial board, which consists of Ted Vogel, Associate Professor of Art, Studio Head in Ceramics, Department of Art, at Lewis &amp; Clark College, Thomas Orr, Professor of Art and head of Ceramics at the Oregon College of Art and Craft, Richard Burkett, Professor of Ceramics at San Diego State University, Ayumi Horie, a studio potter and member of the board of directors of the Archie Bray Foundation, and Julia Galloway, Professor and Director of the School of Art at the University of Montana-Missoula. A team of colleagues at Lewis &amp; Clark College's Aubrey R. Watzek Library serve as Project Managers and Ex-Oficio Members to the Board. This team consists of Mark Dahl, Director of Watzek Library, Jeremy McWilliams, Digital Services Coordinator, and Erica Jensen, Visual Resources &amp; Fine Arts Librarian. The project was founded by Margo Ballantyne (former Visual Resources Curator) and Ted Vogel in 2008.

  <span class="access-text">access</span><span class="ceramics-text">Ceramics</span> merges a traditional academic digital image collection's metadata capabilities with Flickr's openness and flexibility. It seeks to take advantage of Flickr's software tools and social network while also providing a web interface customized to this collection. We expect that individuals will encounter the collection through our website and through the Flickr interface, in a spirit similar to the Library of Congress photo collection in the Flickr Commons. We hope the Collection will serve as a model for future image collections in the arts and humanities. In phase one of the project, we focused on building the collection with our cataloging &amp; submission interface. Phase two will continue expansion of the <span>accessCeramics</span> current artists' image collection and support efforts to build a master artist (historical component for the website.
