<div class='faq_section'><!--the collection section-->
<div class='faq_question'>
Will this site offer more features, or is this it?
	<span>
	We are currently in the process of building the collection, and then will put more focus on rolling out collection features. Thanks for your patience!
	
	
	</span>
</div>
<div class='faq_question'>
Where are all the images and metadata stored?
	<span>
	The images 'live' on Flickr, and we store the metadata in a local database. We also describe the images on Flickr with machine tags, but currently do not use the,.
	</span>
</div>
<div class='faq_question'>
How is the collection juried?
	<span>
	The collection is juried by a five memeber curatorial board.	
	
	</span>
</div>
<div class='faq_question'>
What about the long term preservation of the collection?
	<span>
		We are currently working out a strategy for long term preservation of the collection as well as strategies for migration of the collection to platforms beyond Flickr. Our first step in this process has been to integrate the Creative Commons license into the submissions process for images, thus assuring our ability to repurpose the images outside of Flickr. Some ideas for long term preservation include a dark archive of the collection, and incrementally moving the collection into other larger online collections of art images.

<div class='faq_question'>
Whatare the image quality standards?

</div>
<div class='faq_question'>
Can I just send you a CD with my images?
	<span>
	At this point we are not accepting CDs with images, though we are more than happy to help you through the process of submitting your images on Flickr. Just email us (accessceramics@gmail.com), and we will help you get started.
	</span>
</div>
<div class='faq_question'>
I submitted an image. Why isn't it appearing?
	<span>
	Once submitted, an image waits in a queue for review. We try to review the images in a timely manner, but there may be an occasional delay.

<div class='faq_question'>
What metadata schema do you use?
	<span>
	The metadata fields are a mix of Dublin Core and VRA Core. This route was chosen to simplify the image cataloging process. Most field values in cataloging menus were selected from the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus.
	</span>
</div>
<div class='faq_question'>
How do you deal with copyright issues for the images?
	<span>
	Contributors to the Collection must own the copyright on images submitted. During the cataloging process, each image is assigned a Creative Commons license.	
	</span>
</div>
<div class='faq_question'>
What technologies are used in the site?
	<span>
	This site is written in PHP, and uses phpFlickr to communicate with the Flickr API. The site also uses JQuery for various javascript and AJAX functions. Metadata is stored in a MySQL database.
