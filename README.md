# Access Ceramics

Access Ceramics is a growing collection of images of contemporary ceramics by recognized artists. Founded by Margo Ballantyne (former Visual Resources Curator) and Ted Vogel in 2008, access ceramics is designed for use by artists, arts educators, scholars and the general public, and is intended to fill a void in contemporary ceramics digital image collections on the web. Submissions are juried by a curatorial board and a team of colleagues at Lewis & Clark College's Aubrey R. Watzek Library serve as Project Managers and Ex-Oficio Members to the Board.

The access ceramics website is maintained by Watzek Digital Initiatives.









**The homepage for this website was created from the Start Boostrap template, Creative**
